      3 Principles of Design
    </h1>
    <h2 id="ruleof3rds-head">
      Rule of Thirds
    </h2>
<p id="ruleOfThirds">
  The rule of thirds is a principle of design that says the best pictures or designs 
  have stuff taking up a page in thirds (such as 1/3 or 2/3), or that key elements of 
  a page land on intersections of an even 3x3 grid. <br>
  The organization I found that represented this rule best was How Stuff Works, a
  website known for informational articles on how stuff works in many catagories,
  such as Culture, Home & Garden, Health, Science, and Adventure. You can find 
  them <a href="https://people.howstuffworks.com/cult4.htm">here.</a>
  <img src="cult.png" alt="A screenshot of a page demonstrating the rule of thirds" id="cult">
  In the image shown, the links to the social media are next to an intersection
  of a 3x3 grid, and the body of the article takes up 2/3rds of the page, while
  the heading takes up 1/3rd.

    <h2 id="contrast-head">
      PARC: Contrast
    </h2>
    <p id="contrast">
      Contrast is a principle of design that says that opposing colors draw the 
      eye. This does not only apply to colors, but elements like size, font family,
      spacing, and even emotions. <br> The organization I found that demonstrated
      this principle well was University View's home page, which can be found 
      <a href="https://universityviewrexburg.com/">here.</a> University View is an
      apartment complex for BYU-I students.

      The dark backround gives a nice contrast with the white text.
    </p>
    <h2 id="repetition-head">
      PARC: Repetition
    </h2>
    <p id="repetition">
      Last but not least is repatition. Repatition is a principle of design that 
      states that repeating elements on a page adds unity and improves the design.
      For example, all links having the same format, blue and underlined.<br>
      The page that demonstrated this clearly is the Amazon home page. 
      <img src="amazon.png" alt="Screenshot of the amazon home page, demonstrating repatition" id="amazon">
      Each member of the navigation bar has the same format, and the color yellow 
      is repeated.
